# extractor
Here i attached the whole code in the name of "code".
To run the program download the two text files attached and then run.
Then in the interface it asks to enter original file name then  enter "Original File(Actual Data).txt" (or the name of this file which you gave after downloading).
Then it asks to enter Daily File name then "Attendance on the given day.txt" (or the name of this file which you gave after downloading).
Now it shows the output.
You can also edit the code by changing the pattern search according to your wish
